    <LegalDocument title="Terms of Service" description="These terms govern your access to Opryn. By using the service, you agree to them.">
      <LegalSection title="1. Using Opryn">
        <p>You must be at least 18 years old and able to enter into a binding agreement to use Opryn. If you use Opryn for a company or another organization, you represent that you have authority to accept these terms on its behalf.</p>
        <p>Opryn is currently preparing for early access. Features may be incomplete, change without notice, or be unavailable while we test and improve the service.</p>
      </LegalSection>

      <LegalSection title="2. Accounts">
        <p>You are responsible for keeping your account secure and for activity that occurs through it. You must provide accurate information and promptly notify us if you believe your account has been compromised. Google sign-in is provided through Google and Supabase and is also subject to their applicable terms.</p>
      </LegalSection>

      <LegalSection title="3. Acceptable use">
        <p>You may not misuse Opryn, interfere with its operation, attempt unauthorized access, introduce malicious code, use the service to violate law or another person&apos;s rights, reverse engineer protected portions of the service, or use automated means to burden or scrape the service without permission.</p>
      </LegalSection>

      <LegalSection title="4. Your content">
        <p>You retain ownership of the recordings, procedures, business information, questions, answers, and other content you submit. You grant Opryn permission to host, process, reproduce, and transform that content only as needed to operate, secure, support, and improve the service.</p>
        <p>You are responsible for ensuring you have the rights and permissions needed to submit content, including appropriate notice or consent when recordings or business materials contain information about employees, customers, or other people.</p>
      </LegalSection>

      <LegalSection title="5. Opryn materials">
        <p>Opryn and its licensors retain all rights in the service, software, design, branding, and documentation, excluding your content. These terms give you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable right to use the service for your internal business purposes while your access remains active.</p>
      </LegalSection>

      <LegalSection title="6. Feedback">
        <p>If you provide product ideas or feedback, you allow Opryn to use them without restriction or compensation. This does not give Opryn ownership of your business content.</p>
      </LegalSection>

      <LegalSection title="7. Pricing and early access">
        <p>Pricing displayed on the website is preliminary. Opryn does not currently provide checkout through this site. Before charging you, we will present the applicable price and any additional payment terms for your acceptance.</p>
      </LegalSection>

      <LegalSection title="8. Third-party services">
        <p>Opryn relies on third-party services, including Google, Supabase, and Vercel. We are not responsible for third-party services outside our control, and their separate terms and privacy policies may apply.</p>
      </LegalSection>

      <LegalSection title="9. Suspension and termination">
        <p>You may stop using Opryn at any time. We may suspend or terminate access when reasonably necessary to protect the service, comply with law, respond to misuse, or address a violation of these terms. Sections that by their nature should survive termination will remain in effect.</p>
      </LegalSection>

      <LegalSection title="10. Disclaimers">
        <p>To the extent permitted by law, Opryn is provided “as is” and “as available.” We do not guarantee that the service will be uninterrupted, error-free, or suitable for every business decision. You remain responsible for reviewing generated procedures, rules, and answers before relying on them in your operations.</p>
      </LegalSection>

      <LegalSection title="11. Limitation of liability">
        <p>To the extent permitted by law, Opryn will not be liable for indirect, incidental, special, consequential, exemplary, or punitive damages, or for lost profits, revenue, data, goodwill, or business interruption. Opryn&apos;s total liability arising from the service will not exceed the amount you paid Opryn during the 12 months before the event giving rise to the claim or $100 if you have not paid Opryn.</p>
      </LegalSection>

      <LegalSection title="12. Changes">
        <p>We may update these terms as Opryn develops. We will post the revised terms here and update the effective date. If a material change affects existing users, we will provide reasonable notice when appropriate. Continuing to use Opryn after the updated terms take effect means you accept them.</p>
      </LegalSection>

      <LegalSection title="13. Contact">
        <p>For questions about these terms, submit a message through the early-access form on the <Link href="/">Opryn homepage</Link> and identify it as a terms question.</p>
